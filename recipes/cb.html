    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <li>100ml of the best quality full cream milk you can find. </li>
        <li>1 tea spoon of organic vanilla bean (If you can, get a real vanilla pod and scoop the inside out).</li>
        <li>5 large egg yolks.</li>
        <li>50ml granulated sugar.</li>
        <li>Maple syrup (the best quality you can find, must be organic).</li>

    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat oven to 180°C</li>
        <li>Sit two deep ramekins in a deep roasting tin, at least 10cm deep.</li>
        <li>Slowly pour cream into a small to medium pan and with the milk.</li>
        <li>Slice the vanilla pod in half lengthsways, use the knife to scrape out the vanilla bean seeds into cream/milk mixture and incude the vanilla pod as well.</li>
        <li>Place egg yolks and sugar into mixing bowk and whisk for 1 minute with an electric mixer - until it has a thicker and fluffy form.</li>
        <li>Bring cream/milk mix to a boil on a medium heat - as soon as bubbles appear around the edge of the pot, take it off the heat.</li>
        <li>Pour hot cream mix into the egg mix and stir with wire whisk and ensure you scrape out the seeds from the pan.</li>
        <li>Pour hot mixture through a fine sieve thats sitting on top of a bowl / jug ect. Use a spoon to massage any vanilla seeds through mesh.</li>
        <li>Scoop all the pale foam sitting at the top of the mix, should be a few spoonfuls - dischard and stir the mix. </li>
        <li>Pour hot water in roasting tin. Enough that ramekins are submerged 1.5cm into water.</li>
        <li>Pour hot cream mix into ramekins - fill just below the top.</li>
        <li>Pop them into the oven with baking paper sheet over the top of the tin - loosely to allow airflow through.</li>
        <li>Bake for 30-35 mins, until mixture is set (should be like jelly) should wobble a bit, don't over bake and make them too firm.</li>
        <li>Take ramekins out of the roasting tin - use gloves and set them on a wire rack to cool for 4 mins, then transfer to the fridge.</li>
        <li>Take ramekins out of the fridge and sprinkle 1 and a half tsp of caster sugar on top.</li>
        <li>Use a little maple syrup to slightly dampen the sugar, then use a blow torch to caramelise it (best to keep the torch moving in small circles just above the sugar and maple syrup).</li>
        <li>Serve them up and eat within an hour.</li>
    </ol>
