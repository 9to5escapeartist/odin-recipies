    undivided attention.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>6 eggs, straight out of the fridge and cold</li>
        <li>15g butter, </li>
        <li>Seasoning, salt, pepper</li>
        <li>Crème fraîche</li>
        <li>Chives</li>
        <li>Chilli flakes, not optional - spice up that day sunshine</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Cooking instructions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Grab your 6 cold eggs, crack them into a frying pan that is non-stick.</li>
        <li>Add the butter slowly, it is best to do it gradually, a little here and there.</li>
        <li>Turn the burner up, it's cooking time.</li>
        <li>Use a rubber spatula and continually srape the bottom of the pan as the egg cooks.</li>
        <li>After 45 seconds, take the pan off the heat, and then keep stirring, after 20 seconds put it back on the heat. Do this for 3-4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Now the magic. Add a tablespoon of Crème fraîche and season with salt and pepper, add the chilli flakes too, if you are spicy and you know it.</li>
        <li>Plate up those eggs with the best bit of buttery bread you have, I, personally like some crusty fresh sourdough, because I love myself.</li>
    </ol>
